NOTE:    sndview only deals with mono files.

It tries not to fail silently, rather printing
a warning out in the shell.  But then it will 
happily go along and display whatever file 
you feed it as if it were mono.
Results will be not generally as desired
if you feed it a stereo or multi-channel file.

Also, no mp3, m4a, or other compressed files.
.wav also supports some compressed data, but
sndview is completely ignorant of this.  So
it's possible you'll find files that look like
garbage in sndview.

Load such files into a sound editor that 
understands them, then convert and save it
out as 16 bit mono.
